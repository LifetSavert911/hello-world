[Learning Github]
Hi Humans!

My name is LifetSavert911 and I am following the "hello-world" tutorial on Github. I am new to programing.
I am just starting to learn it and I want to make games and apps. Github was a part of that goal as well as Udemy and self-learning and research. And asking the communities. I also want to stream on Twitch and eventually learn Adobe programs. First I would like to learn how to make good videos with Premiere and After Effects. Then the web and game related programs.
